# Dice-Rolling-App
A simple Dice Rolling app built in Java for Android. It generates random dice rolls with animations and sound effects when the user presses the roll button. The app uses images of dice faces and animates them on the screen with a shaking effect. A fun, interactive experience for users.

## Features

- **Dice Rolling**: The app simulates the rolling of two dice with random values between 1 and 6.
- **Animations**: The dice images shake upon rolling using the YoYo animation library.
- **Sound Effects**: A dice roll sound plays every time the dice are rolled, enhancing the experience.
- **User Interface**: The app features a simple layout with buttons for interaction and images for dice faces.

## Requirements

- Android Studio
- YoYo Animation Library (`com.daimajia.androidanimations:library:2.4@aar`)
- Android MediaPlayer for sound effects

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
3. Run the app on your Android device or emulator.

## How It Works

1. When the **Roll Dice** button is pressed, the app generates random values between 1 and 6 for two dice.
2. The dice images are updated to show the respective faces of the dice.
3. The dice images shake using an animation effect to simulate a real dice roll.
4. A sound effect is played whenever the dice are rolled.
